Where there once stood a large red-roofed building, there is now open space, contributing to a sense of openness in a now more densely built environment. The riverside gains further enhancement with additional greenery and the creation of a small recreational zone, featuring a track and a sports court, which invites community activity. Within the expanded residential block, new smaller structures have emerged, suggesting ongoing development and potential increases in local amenities or housing options. These developments reflect a shift toward residential expansion and recreational accessibility along the river corridor."
