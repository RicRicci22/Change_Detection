The analysis shows that the regions of trees, low vegetation, and non-vegetated ground surface have changed in the pre-change image, and the regions of buildings and low vegetation have changed in the post-event image. The largest change was observed in the regions of buildings, while the smallest change was observed in the regions of trees. The percentage of changed regions was found to be between 0 to 10, and the majority of the area has not changed.",

The change percentage of water in the pre-change image was 0.",

The change ratio of trees and low vegetation in the pre-event image was 0, and the change ratio of water in the pre-change image was also 0. On the other hand, the change ratio of buildings in the first image was 0 to 10, and the change ratio of water in the second image was 0 to 10. The change proportion of buildings in the post-change image was 10 to 20. The percentage of changed areas was 10 to 20, and the percentage of non-change regions was 80 to 90.",

The pre-event image has mainly witnessed a change in non-vegetated ground surface, which has been converted into buildings. The regions of low vegetation have also changed to non-vegetated ground surface. However, the areas of trees, water, and playgrounds have not witnessed any significant changes. In the post-event image, there has been an increase in the regions of buildings, while the other land cover types have remained relatively unchanged. Overall, around 80 to 90 percent of the areas have remained unchanged, while the remaining 10 to 20 percent have undergone changes.",

The regions of non-vegetated ground surface, low vegetation, water, and buildings were found to have changed in both images. However, the regions of trees and playgrounds did not change significantly. The largest change in the pre-event image was observed in non-vegetated ground surface, while in the post-event image, it was observed in buildings. The percentage of changed areas was found to be between 0 to 10%, while the percentage of unchanged areas was between 90 to 100%.",
